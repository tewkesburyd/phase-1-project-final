# phase-1-project

This project fetches data from TVMaze api for the television show Chef's Table.

A search function is included at the top of the page. This function allows the user to select a specific season of the show and will display only episdes in the respective season.

A watch list is provided which allows users to add episodes.

It then creates an element for each episode and appends it to the html. 
    Each element contains an title, image, show rating, and description.
    Each elememnt will have a ratings button below the image that allows the user to give their own rating.
    Each element will have a button that allows the user to add a specific episode to their watch list.

The js code for this project is written in a way that allows for adaption of different shows from TVMaze with minimum alteration.

To run this project, run "open index.html" in the terminal
